/* Comparing Framer Motion to CSS Animations:
 *
 * Framer Motion allows dynamic animations based on state
 * CSS animations work great for simple effects, like hover,
 * especially if nothing is being resized based on state.
 *
 * For example, the following CSS animation will work
 * beautifully at regular size, but not in fullscreen mode.
