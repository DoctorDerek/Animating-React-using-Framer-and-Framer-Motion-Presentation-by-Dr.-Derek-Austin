----------
### What's the difference between Framer and Framer Motion?
Framer is an awesome prototyping tool that has a React library to support animations.

Framer Motion is the updated and stand-alone version of the animation library, but many tutorials online still use the older "Framer" library.

### Why might you use Framer Motion instead of CSS animations?
Framer Motion allows dynamic animations based on state CSS animations work great for simple effects, like hover, especially if nothing is being resized based on state.

The presentation has examples of CSS animations that will work differently in full-screen display vs. regular size.
